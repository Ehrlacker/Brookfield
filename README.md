# Brookfield

## Description
* Brookfield is an application that allows users to find and plan trips in and around US National Parks. My inspiration for this project came from my previous career as a Park Ranger. As a Park Ranger I visited many local, City, and State parks but i've never been to a National Park. I wanted a way to find National Parks and be able to have the ability to plan either day or extended trips to these parks.
